My name is Aarthiya, and I’m from Madurai. I recently completed my B.Tech in Information Technology at Thiagaraja College of Engineering. My studies, combined with hands-on project work, have given me a strong foundation in programming and front-end development.I am proficient in programming, with expertise in Java and Python, which I have utilized in various projects and problem-solving tasks, with hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I use to create responsive, engaging front-end interfaces.Throughout my studies, I have undertaken several projects that enhanced my technical and problem-solving abilities.
One of my key projects is an AI-enabled phishing detection system, where we used Python and AI models to detect malicious websites and alert users. This project aims to provide an additional layer of security, minimizing risks such as data breaches and financial losses.

I also developed an Ambulance Tracking and Patient Monitoring System, utilizing Arduino and IoT technology. This system provides real-time ambulance tracking, sending updates to the nearest hospital to ensure timely care preparation upon arrival.

Another significant project is a Student Tracking App, a mobile application that allows students, parents, and professors to monitor student performance. This app was developed using Android Studio, Java, XML, and Firebase, making it a valuable tool for performance analytics.

Beyond my technical work, I served as an active placement representative and a team leader in many academic projects, which helped me build strong leadership skills. I am also a member of the Tamil club, where I participate in cultural events. In my free time, I enjoy dancing, drawing, and problem-solving on LeetCode and SkillRack to enhance my coding skills.

My immediate goal is to secure a position in your company, where I can continue to develop my skills. Long-term, I aim to advance within the organization, taking on greater responsibilities and contributing meaningfully to the team.
